# Movie Recommendation: Developing an algorithm to predict user ratings of movies
In this project I develop a machine learning algorithm that predicts movie ratings based on the [MovieLens](http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-10m.zip) dataset.
Please see the project report written in RMarkdown for a thorough look at the project.
